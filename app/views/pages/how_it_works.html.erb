        Hospitality enables people to unite through a shared spirit of mutual hosting. Hospitality makes it easier to discover and connect with positive people in every country, so when you are travelling or migrating through the world it becomes a little easier and more open. Through automatic location based searching, Hospitality allows you to discover and connect with new, likeminded people in a far away place or in your own area or city. It bridges connections both globally and locally.
